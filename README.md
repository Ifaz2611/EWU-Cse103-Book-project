# 📚 Book Heaven - Simple Bookshop Management System in C

Welcome to **Book Heaven**, a simple console-based bookshop management system written in C. This project is ideal for beginners learning file structures, structs, user input handling, and menu-driven programs in C.

## 🚀 Features

- Display a welcome message and a main menu
- Show all available books with details
- Add new books (title, author, price, copies)
- Search books by title (case-insensitive)
- Display the total number of book copies in the system
- Exit with a goodbye message

## 📂 Project Structure

- `main.c` - The complete source code containing all logic and menu handling.
- No external files or dependencies required.

## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

### 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler like `gcc` installed.

### 🔧 Compilation

```bash
gcc main.c -o bookshop
````

### ▶️ Run

```bash
./bookshop
```

## 🧾 Menu Options

Once running, you'll see a menu with the following options:

1. Display this menu again
2. Show all available books
3. Add a book to the bookshop
4. Search a book by title
5. Display the total number of books
6. Exit the system

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* `struct` for managing book records
* Arrays for storing book data
* Menu-driven loops using `do-while`
* Input handling with `scanf`, `fgets`, and buffer management
* Case-insensitive string comparison with `strcasecmp`

## ✨ Sample Output

```text
